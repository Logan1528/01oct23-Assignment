Q1. Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid 
layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other ?


The basic difference between CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout is that flexbox was
 designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for
 two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.


When would you choose to use one over the other ?

When comparing the two, the main difference is that CSS Grid is better suited for creating
 two-dimensional layouts, while CSS Flexbox is better for one-dimensional designs. 
Moreover, using CSS Grid, elements are positioned using numerical coordinates, whereas
 Flexbox uses relative positioning and margins.
